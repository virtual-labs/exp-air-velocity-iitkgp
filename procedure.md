## Procedure

1. Measure the Wet-bulb temperature (TW) by Assmann Psychrometer.
2. Dip the bulb of Kata thermometer in hot water so that alcohol level rises above 38°C mark, and then wipe the bulb with a dry cloth.
3. Then place the Kata-thermometer in front of the duct. After few seconds, the alcohol will drop down from 38°C to 35°C. Note the time using stopwatch.
4. Note the air velocity reading given by vane anemometer.
5. Change the air velocity using flow regulator and note the time and find out the Kata cooling power.
6. Take the wet bulb temperature of air using Assmann Psychrometer.
7. Plot the graph between Kata cooling power and air velocity.
