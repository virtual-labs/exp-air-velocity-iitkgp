## Objective

The purpose of this experiment is to get familiarized with Kata thermometer and its operation, and then estimation of cooling power of any working environment. In addition this experiment also addresses how the wet bulb temperature (T<sub>W</sub>) and velocity of air (v) influence the cooling power of the air.
